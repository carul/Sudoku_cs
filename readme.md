# SUDOKU

Hi!
This is my first bigger C# application.<br/>
It is a simple sudoku with it's own generator (based on permutations)<br/>
<br/>
It is of course open source, feel free to modify and commit if you wish, but remember<br/>
To add previous authors.<br/>

<hr>
In the releases there is a multiplatform .exe which you can run this way on Linux <br/>
mono program.exe<br/>
<br/>
__Have Fun!__
